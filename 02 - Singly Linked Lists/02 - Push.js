//PUSH
//The 1st time we push a node it checks if the head exists. Since we created an empty list (no head), the created node is set as head + tail.
//The 2nd time a value is pushed, the current tailâ€™s next node is set to the next node, which ends up being the same as: this.head.next = newNode. 
//the tail gets updated to point to the newNode.
//Afterwards every push just updates the previous tail.next to point to the new node (the new tail).
